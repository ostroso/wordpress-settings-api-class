Why a fork?
---------------
I've found this class very useful and flexible for theme development. But I need a more advanced field that saves the id of an attachment-image for use like homepage slideshow. So it must be also repeatable.
I'd like also having a link field to a specific post or page or archive that connects to the other for clickable slideshow.
